# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
The error you‚Äôre seeing is caused by Vite (which uses esbuild) not finding the correct native binary (@esbuild/darwin-arm64) for your macOS ARM64 architecture (likely an Apple Silicon Mac like M1/M2).

Here‚Äôs how to fix it:

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Fix Steps
	1.	Delete existing node_modules and lock file (in case of corrupted or missing packages):

rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

	2.	Clear npm cache (to avoid cached issues):

npm cache clean --force

	3.	Reinstall dependencies normally:

npm install

‚ö†Ô∏è Do NOT use --omit=optional or --no-optional flags. These are critical for esbuild‚Äôs native binaries.

	4.	Start your Vite server again:

npm run dev


‚∏ª

üí° If you‚Äôre using Yarn, use:

rm -rf node_modules yarn.lock
yarn cache clean
yarn install


‚∏ª

Let me know if you‚Äôre using pnpm, or if npm install still doesn‚Äôt fix the issue.
